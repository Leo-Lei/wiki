1. Download IntelliJ IDEA
[IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is a Java IDE developed by jetbrains team.
> The jetbrains team also develop some other famous product, for example, the best plugin for Microsoft Visual Studio - Resharper.

You can download the latest IntelliJ IDEA distribution from the [official download page](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/). There are two versions of IntelliJ IDEA, Ultimate Edition and Community Edition(free). If you want to use the Ultimate Edition version without paying money, you can search the key on Google or Baidu. I will not supply the key here.

2. Install IntelliJ IDEA
On Windows, execute the exe file, and follow the installation steps - just need to click Next.
On Mac, open the dmg file, and drag the app file to the `Applicaiton` folder, that's all.

3. Common Keymap
